Inspired by Nora Sandler's adaptation of Abdulaziz Ghuloum's "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction", we implement a LLVM frontend for C, in incremental steps, using C++. Note that Nora Sandler directly compiles to assembly, while we (in anticipation of the project becoming increasingly complicated, later on in the process, and in order to take advantage of the optimization pipeline of LLVM to generate code that has remotely reasonable runtimes), compile to LLVM's IR from the very start. As our approach does not strictly follow either Sandler or Ghuloum's approaches, we document the taks accomplished at each stage here for easy reference.

Stage 1: Set up layout of lexer, parser, and code generation from an AST. Parse (signed, 32 bit) integer literals, and return them from main.

Stage 2: Add unary operators and some basic context/value classes to keep track of SSA registers.

Stage 3: Add binary operators, parentheses for grouping, and operator precedence (essentially using [Pratt parsing](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html)), added code to automatically call llc and g++ to create an executable. (We don't call opt beforehand, but one could do so to create more optimized code). This now allows our program to be tested with Nora Sandler's test suite/script (forked to [here](https://github.com/AMLeng/incremental_c_compiler_tests)).
